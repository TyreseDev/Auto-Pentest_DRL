# AutoPentest-DRL: Automated Penetration Testing Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

AutoPentest-DRL is an automated penetration testing framework based on
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques. AutoPentest-DRL can
determine the most appropriate attack path for a given logical
network, and can also be used to execute a penetration testing attack
on a real network via tools such as Nmap and Metasploit. This
framework is intended for educational purposes, so that users can
study the penetration testing attack mechanisms.

An overview of AutoPentest-DRL is shown below. The framework receives
user input regarding the logical target network, including
vulnerability information; alternatively, the framework can use Nmap
for network scanning to find actual vulnerabilities in a real target
network with known topology. The MulVAL attack-graph generator is then
used to determine potential attack trees, which are fed in a
simplified form into the DRL engine. The attack path that is produced
as output can be used to study the attack mechanisms on a large number
of logical networks. Alternatively, the framework can use the attack
path with penetration testing tools, such as Metasploit, making it
possible for the user to study how the attack can be carried out on a
real target network.

Next we provide brief information on how to setup and use
AutoPentest-DRL. For details about its operation, please refer to the
[User Guide](/user_guide.md) that we also make available.

## Setup

Build and push the Docker image.

```
sudo bash publish.sh
```

## Quick Start

Start the Docker container.

```
sudo docker run -it tyrese3915/auto-pentest_drl
```

AutoPentest-DRL can be used out-of-the-box on a sample logical network
topology by running the following command in a terminal from the
`auto-pentest_drl/` directory:

```
python3 ./AutoPentest-DRL.py logical_attack
```

In this **logical attack mode** no actual attack is conducted, and
AutoPentest-DRL will only determine the optimal attack path for the
logical network topology that is described in the file
`MulVal_P/logical_attack_v1.P`. By comparing the output path with the
visualization of the attack graph that is generated by MulVAL in the
file `mulval_results/AttackGraph.pdf` you can study in detail the
logical attack steps.

For more information about the operation of AutoPentest-DRL, including
the **real attack mode** to be used when conducting penetration
testing on real networks, see our [User Guide](/user_guide.md).
